# Simulation 2D
In the parameters.py (or directly in launcher.py) file you can change the simulation parameters as the velocity of the cells, the space size etc...
The algorithm simulate the bacteria Myxococcus xanthus shape as a succession of rigid spheres. Several functions can be used to add interactions between each agents: alignment, eps following, different type of contacts, different implementation of the velocity (A and S motility in myxo), rigidity, reversals...

## Installation
1. Clonez le dépôt :
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MignotLab/simulations_2d.git

## Utilisation
Open launcher.py, and launch the cells to start simulations of rippling and swarming.
