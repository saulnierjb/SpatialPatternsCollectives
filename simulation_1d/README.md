# Simulation 1D
Simulation of both age- and phase- structured models.
simulation_1d.py simulate the age-strutured model with the refractory period modulation.
simulation_1d_igoshin simulate the phase-structured model.
simulation_1d_igoshin_rp simulate the phase-structured model with refractory period modulation.

## Installation
1. Clonez le dépôt :
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MignotLab/simulations_1d.git

## Utilisation
Open simulation_1d.py or simulation_1d_igoshin or simulation_1d_igoshin_rp, and launch all the cells.
In the parameters.py file you can change the simulation parameters as the velocity of the cells, the space size etc...
